# Pygame1
I have coded a program for Pygame. This plays a major role in Python. It is very easy to use with all options. I have also added color for snake movement. It will move by eating every box. If you lose, it will also ask if you want to quit, cancel, or play the game once more. It is a very enthusiastic program which everyone can easily understand.
